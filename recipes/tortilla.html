        <p>Fiesta Corn Tortilla Pizzas</p> 

        <p> We all love Mexican flavors and plate-sized pizzas, so 
            it's a wonder this super-simple dish isn't a staple at 
            home or at most neighborhood Mexican restaurants. This 
            Oaxacan dish consists of a large tortilla that's topped 
            with refried beans and seared or baked, then finished with 
            toppings like cotija cheese, tomato, and avocado. It's different 
            from tostadas, which are smaller and deep-fried. Try these 
            Mexican-inspired Fiesta Corn Tortilla Pizzas for a true tlayuda 
            experience, or use the tortilla pizza inspiration for crowd-pleasing 
            BBQ Chicken Tortilla Pizzas.

            I devised this simple snack for my Cinco de Mayo Fiesta 
            party years ago. An instant hit, they get gobbled up so 
            fast that I enlist guests and form an assembly line at the 
            grill, no skillet needed. Guests love being involved in the action.

        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>6 (7 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li> 1 ¾ cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
            <li>3 roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and diced</li>
            <li> 2 green onions, sliced</li>
            <li> ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, well drained</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave on high until warmed through, about 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Spray both sides of each corn tortilla with cooking spray and arrange them on a wire rack.</li>
          <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry one side of each tortilla until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Return tortillas to wire rack, browned sides up.</li>
          <li>Spread a thin layer of refried beans onto the tortillas, stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over refried beans.</li>
          <li>Carefully transfer a tortilla pizza back to the skillet, bean side up.</li>
          <li>Lightly fry until cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute more; return tortilla pizza to wire rack. Repeat with remaining pizzas.</li>
          <li>Scatter tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, and olives over melted cheese.</li>
          <li>Slice pizzas to serve.</li>
        </ol>
