        <p>Slow-Cooker Pozole</p> 

        <p>Traditional Mexican Posole is served with shredded cabbage, 
            lime wedges, avocado, onion, cilantro, and, of course, warm 
            tortillas. Many Mexican markets have posole meat already 
            chopped up for you. You can add another can of hominy if your 
            slow-cooker is large. I prefer hot enchilada sauce with salsa, 
            but the regular kind will do.

            What makes this Mexican soup different from a tortilla soup or 
            chili is the addition of hominy—a type of corn that's been dried 
            and rehydrated to give it a chewy, starchy texture. Just like chili, 
            you'll find white and red versions, vegetarian and meat versions, 
            and loaded and simplified versions. Enjoy this Slow Cooker Pozole 
            with lots of fresh toppings. "Traditional Mexican Posole is served 
            with shredded cabbage, lime wedges, avocado, onion, cilantro, and, 
            of course, warm tortillas," says Jules, who submitted the recipe.
