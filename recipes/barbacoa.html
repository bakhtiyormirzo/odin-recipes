        <p>Barbacoa-Style Shredded Beef</p>

        <p>
            If beef tacos make you think of ground beef and lots of seasoning, 
            you have to give barbacoa a try. Traditionally, a whole goat or 
            sheep is buried in an underground oven and slowly cooked overnight. 
            Modern versions use beef cuts like chuck roast and are braised in 
            the oven or cooked in the slow cooker. This Barbacoa-Style Shredded 
            Beef uses the slow cooker. The result is so tender you could pull the 
            meat apart with a fork. Pile onto tacos, tostadas, or burritos.
